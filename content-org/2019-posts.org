*** DONE Sticking with Dropbox :dropbox:icloud:
CLOSED: [2019-07-12 Fri 10:01]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: sticking-with-dropbox
:END:

It's fashionable lately to "ditch" Dropbox for other sync services. The reasons stated are usually around cost or privacy. This is understandable, but for anyone with a significant number of files and/or services using Dropbox, the time and complexity of switching could easily be costlier than what it would be to just continue using Dropbox.

Dropbox has only rarely caused me grief, and only with resource usage. Sometimes the client takes too many of them. Otherwise, it's been reliable and dependable for many years.

I've used Syncthing and Resilio Sync as alternatives. Both are fine, but other services depending on sync don't often support them, meaning I /still/ need to use Dropbox for some of my "stuff". This puts me in the unhappy situation of keeping things in 2 places. I did this for a while, and it ended up a confusing mess.

iCloud is handy, but only on my Macs and iOS devices. It's also never been as dependable as Dropbox. I've lost things. And stories like [[https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/11/icloud-data-loss-with-macos-10-15-and-ios-13-betas/][iCloud data loss with macos and ios 13 betas]] doesn't help my confidence.

I use Dropbox on Linux and I once fumblefingered a command and deleted a bunch of files. These were easily restored using Dropbox. I like the way Dropbox works today.

As much as I love to try new things, I don't feel that my file storage and sync system would benefit from the sort of tinkering that be would required to change it.

I'm bucking the trend and sticking with Dropbox.



*** DONE Wrangling Hugo's RSS templates :hugo:
CLOSED: [2019-07-06 Sat 09:21]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: wrangling-hugo-s-rss-templates
:END:

I just lost an hour "fixing" [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo's]] handling of RSS feeds.

Hugo's default rss template only includes each post's =.Summary=, but I want to include the full =.Content=. There is no configuration setting for this, so in order to include full post content I have to override the entire template. This seems nuts to me, but whatever. I had already done this a while ago and it's worked fine...until I updated Hugo to v0.55.0.

Hugo's 0.55.0 release introduced (what I consider) a breaking change which caused the RSS feed to include /all/ posts. The =rssLimit= configuration setting was replaced by a =[services.rss]= which relies on =Config.Services.RSS.Limit=. I wish someone would've told me. To be fair, there is something about this in the release notes but it's not obvious and doesn't call anything out as a breaking change, so I missed it.

I dutifully changed my settings to match, but it didn't fix the problem. Of course it didn't, because I'd overridden the default template and my version had no idea about =Config.Services.RSS.Limit=. The default RSS template is internal to Hugo but is [[https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/][shown in the documentation]]. I copied it over my own template, re-did my change to =.Summary= but still no luck. My RSS feed was still showing /all/ posts. Turns out the version in the docs was wrong. Instead, I poked around the code and found the [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml][actual source for the default RSS template]] and copied /that/ to ./layouts/index.rss.xml. Finally, I was again seeing full content and only the first 20 posts in the feed.

The problem then was that the feed contained entries for other non-post files that I'd edited. I only want posts in the feed, so I had to make an additional change to the template. The default is...

#+begin_example go
{{- $pages := Data.Pages -}}
#+end_example


I changed mine to...

#+begin_example go
{- $pages := (where .Data.Pages "Type" "post") -}}
#+end_example





Here's my final version of the template.

#+begin_src go
{{- $pages := (where .Data.Pages "Type" "post") -}}
{{- $limit := .Site.Config.Services.RSS.Limit -}}
{{- if ge $limit 1 -}}
{{- $pages = $pages | first $limit -}}
{{- end -}}
{{ printf "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\" ?>" | safeHTML }}
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    <title>{{ if eq  .Title  .Site.Title }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ else }}{{ with .Title }}{{.}} on {{ end }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ end }}</title>
    <link>{{ .Permalink }}</link>
    <description>Recent content {{ if ne  .Title  .Site.Title }}{{ with .Title }}in {{.}} {{ end }}{{ end }}on {{ .Site.Title }}</description>

    <language>{{.}}</language>{{end}}{{ with .Site.Author.email }}
    <managingEditor>{{.}}{{ with $.Site.Author.name }} ({{.}}){{end}}</managingEditor>{{end}}{{ with .Site.Author.email }}
    <webMaster>{{.}}{{ with $.Site.Author.name }} ({{.}}){{end}}</webMaster>{{end}}{{ with .Site.Copyright }}
    <copyright>{{.}}</copyright>{{end}}{{ if not .Date.IsZero }}
    <lastBuildDate>{{ .Date.Format "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" | safeHTML }}</lastBuildDate>{{ end }}
    {{ with .OutputFormats.Get "RSS" }}
        {{ printf "<atom:link href=%q rel=\"self\" type=%q />" .Permalink .MediaType | safeHTML }}
	{{ end }}
    {{- range $pages -}}
    <item>
      <title>{{ .Title }}</title>
      <link>{{ .Permalink }}</link>
      <pubDate>{{ .Date.Format "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" | safeHTML }}</pubDate>
      {{ with .Site.Author.email }}<author>{{.}}{{ with $.Site.Author.name }} ({{.}}){{end}}</author>{{end}}
      <guid>{{ .Permalink }}</guid>
      <description>{{ .Content | html }}</description>
    </item>
    {{ end }}
  </channel>
</rss>
#+end_src

And in config.toml I've replaced =rssLimit= with this...

#+begin_src toml
[services.rss]
  limit = 20
#+end_src

If there's an easier way to do all this I'd love to hear about it. Maybe the addition of the new =[services.rss]= section suggests other pending improvements. Ideally, I wouldn't need to override the entire RSS template in order to make these changes. And I'll be sure to read the release notes more thoroughly next time.

*** DONE Automatic Cross-posting :blogging:social:
CLOSED: [2019-07-05 Fri 13:16]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: automatic-cross-posting
:END:

Should I automatically cross-post from baty.net to all the usual places? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I would just be adding noise where no more noise is needed. Other times I figure what the hell, everyone else does it and people seem to love noise. Besides, it's fun to share.

What I realized was that I often wish some of the people I follow would write more posts or show more photos or otherwise add to my feed. In the unlikely event that there are people out there who feel that way about me, I've once again enabled cross-posting. Apologies in advance if you're not one of them.

Instabuy if true. It /has/ to be better than the butterfly nonsense I'm working with now

#+begin_quote
So here’s the thing I keep coming back to: I think of NetNewsWire as almost a kind of ideal public utility. As such, it should be completely trustworthy — you should never wonder if it’s leading you down some path or other you didn’t intend or foresee.

"trustworthy" is a good word and a great feature.

*** DONE Resurrecting baty.net (for now) :meta:blogging:hugo:
CLOSED: [2019-07-04 Thu 08:14]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: resurrecting-baty-dot-net--for-now
:END:

There are two things that cause me to occasionally abandon this blog at baty.net for something else.

The first is friction. Hosting with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is wonderful, but /posting/ can feel like more trouble than it's worth. That's when things like [[https://blot.im][Blot]] or [[https://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] start to look tempting.

The second is boredom. I love trying new things, so whenever I find some new blogging tool, I trick myself into thinking "This is the one, for real this time!"

So, I stop posting here and add a message letting my handful of readers know where I've gone. Of course then I find myself looking something up here that I know I posted some time in the past 15 years and poking around and wondering why I ever left.

Since re-discovering [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo - Org to Hugo exporter]], I've found ways to reduce the friction of publishing posts. And I love writing in Emacs and Org-mode.

All this to say that I've dusted off baty.net, re-jiggered my Hugo setup, and will be posting here again for a while.

I have a few other interests:

*Photography*. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera
collecting.” I shoot both film and digital and upload to [[https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty][Flickr]]

*Analog*. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like
film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and
fountain pens.
