*** DONE Automatic Cross-posting :blogging:social:

Should I automatically cross-post from baty.net to all the usual places? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I would just be adding noise where no more noise is needed. Other times I figure what the hell, everyone else does it and people seem to love noise. Besides, it's fun to share.

What I realized was that I often wish some of the people I follow would write more posts or show more photos or otherwise add to my feed. In the unlikely event that there are people out there who feel that way about me, I've once again enabled cross-posting. Apologies in advance if you're not one of them.

#+begin_quote
In a report published today, Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple will roll out a new keyboard design based on scissor switches, offering durability and longer key travel, starting with the 2019 MacBook Air.

Instabuy if true. It /has/ to be better than the butterfly nonsense I'm working with now

#+begin_quote
So here’s the thing I keep coming back to: I think of NetNewsWire as almost a kind of ideal public utility. As such, it should be completely trustworthy — you should never wonder if it’s leading you down some path or other you didn’t intend or foresee.

"trustworthy" is a good word and a great feature.

*** DONE Resurrecting baty.net (for now) :meta:blogging:hugo:

There are two things that cause me to occasionally abandon this blog at baty.net for something else.

The first is friction. Hosting with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is wonderful, but /posting/ can feel like more trouble than it's worth. That's when things like [[https://blot.im][Blot]] or [[https://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] start to look tempting.

The second is boredom. I love trying new things, so whenever I find some new blogging tool, I trick myself into thinking "This is the one, for real this time!"

So, I stop posting here and add a message letting my handful of readers know where I've gone. Of course then I find myself looking something up here that I know I posted some time in the past 15 years and poking around and wondering why I ever left.

Since re-discovering [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo - Org to Hugo exporter]], I've found ways to reduce the friction of publishing posts. And I love writing in Emacs and Org-mode.

All this to say that I've dusted off baty.net, re-jiggered my Hugo setup, and will be posting here again for a while.

*Hello, I'm Jack Baty*.

** A little about me

I’ve been a partner at [[https://fusionary.com][Fusionary Media]] since 1995. Fusionary is a
terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your business needs
something built for the web or mobile devices you should [[mailto:info@fusionary.com][send us a
note]].

I blog at *[[https://www.baty.net/][baty.net]]* ✒️

I've also been having a ball at my new wiki: [[https://rudimentarylathe.org][Rudimentary Lathe]].

You can email me at [[mailto:jack@baty.net][jack@baty.net]] ✉️

If you use ProtonMail and prefer a more secure method: [[mailto:jbaty@pm.me][jbaty@pm.me]] ✉️

I have a few other interests:

*Photography*. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera
collecting.” I shoot both film and digital and upload to [[https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty][Flickr]]

*Analog*. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like
film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and
fountain pens.

See the [[/now][Now page]] for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

**Do not expect consistency**.
