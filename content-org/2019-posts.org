*** DONE Why I switched to... :productivity:
CLOSED: [2019-08-25 Sun 10:00]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: why-i-switched-to-dot-dot-dot
:END:
I could write a post every day titled "Why I switched to [INSERT TOOL HERE]."

I don't do that, because 90% of the time the reasons I switch from one tool to another have little to do with how I'd characterize them in a blog post. In other words, most of my "reasons" for switching, while based on facts, are still bullshit[fn:2].

See, most of the time I'm just bored and want to try something new. 

I rarely try new things when I'm actually busy or productive. I can be productive with any text editor at all. Or any todo manager, or any git client, or any browser, or any shell, or any terminal, or any operating system, or any blogging system, or any image editor, or any keyboard, or any camera, or any film developer, or... you see what I mean.

I do like to try new things, and if I'm being honest, there are only 3 reasons I switch tools:

1. Boredom
2. Procrastination
3. Curiosity

Everything else is rationalization[fn:1].

Yep, I'm [[https://jackbaty.tumblr.com/][posting to Tumblr again]]. It could just be nostalgia, but I've been thinking about Tumblr ever since Matt [[https://photomatt.tumblr.com/post/186964618222/automattic-tumblr][announced the purchase]].

I posted to Tumblr for the [[https://jackbaty.tumblr.com/post/3645/first-post][first time on Febuary 24th, 2007]] and continued pretty regularly through 2015, right about the time Yahoo was determined to ruin it.

I really liked Tumblr. I liked the content, the easy posting UI, the "community", the weirdness, all of it.

Like SmugMug taking over Flickr, Automattic owning Tumblr is the best turn of events I can think of, so I'm optimistically starting to post there again. No idea yet what effect it will have on my current posting venues, but what counts is that I'm having fun.
*** DONE Update on using Elfeed :rss:elfeed:

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: update-on-using-elfeed
:END:

It turns out that most of the problems I wrote about in [[https://www.baty.net/2018/i-failed-at-using-elfeed-as-my-rss-reader/][I Failed at Using Elfeed as My RSS Reader]] were due to the "improvements" introduced by the [[https://github.com/algernon/elfeed-goodies][elfeed-goodies package]]. Removing that package made Elfeed behave as I'd expect, and now I'm reading feeds in Emacs again :)

This isn't likely to replace [[https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/][NetNewsWire]] for the majority of my read-for-pleasure feeds, but it's quite nice for cranking through more "transactional" feeds.


*** DONE Fewer of more
CLOSED: [2019-08-15 Thu 13:11]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: less-of-more
:END:

I'd like to have fewer of more things. Does that make sense? Right now
I have five of everything and it's driving me nuts.

I know, I know, I'm the type of person who likes to try different
things; to have options, but that may be changing. At least it feels like
it's changing. It could very well be just another short-lived mood,
but I'm tired of making decisions.

Here are some of the things I'm working on having fewer of.

*Software*. I use way too many apps. They overlap in various ways that
make it impossible to decide which to use for what. I switch between
them and then need to "refactor my workflow" on a monthly basis. As
fun as it is to play with software, my state of mind is telling me to
cut back.

How do I do that? By using Emacs. When I'm in the mood for
easy/pointy/clicky software, I try quitting Emacs. Doing so requires
that I find apps to replace all the things that Emacs had been doing,
and I'm back in the 3-apps-for-each-task conundrum. So now I'm using
Emacs and Org-mode for everything that makes sense.

Using Emacs eliminates the need to decide between the following:

- Things or OmniFocus for tasks
- Tinderbox or Apple Notes or TheBrain or DEVONthink or Bear or Ulysses for notes
- Timings or Timular for time tracking
- BBEdit or VSCode or Vim for text editing
- Mail.app or MailMate for email
- TiddlyWiki or TheBrain or Tinderbox or DEVONthink for project/client
  notes

And so on. 

*Notebooks*. I love paper notebooks, but deciding which to carry or use
 is debilitating. I'm down to three: A Field Notes pocket notebook for
 away-from-computer capture, A Leuchtturm for my version of Bullet
 Journal, and a Hobonich Techo for calendar and date-based stuff. Yes,
 that's still three notebooks but it's down from five or six. I'll
 miss the Midori and the Rotterfaden but I have to stop trying to use
 them all at once.

*Cameras*. Admit it, there's no way I'm going to stop using a bunch of
different cameras. I don't know how to addres this yet, but I spend
way too much time organizing cameras and bags to get my "kit" /just
right/.

The smartest move would be Leica M6 for everyday film, Fuji X-T3 for
digital, and the Hasselblad for "serious" work. But then the beautiful
Leica M4 shows up and what about the big Speed Graphic? And that Leica
Q is amazing. Still thinking about this one.

*Clothing*. My least favorite thing is picking out an "outfit" to
wear. I don't think I could pull of a Jobsian uniform, but I'd like to
not spend 15 minutes wondering what goes with what today. I'm working
on getting my wardrobe down to a few types of things, all in simple
colors that work together. Not there yet.

*Devices*. There's no way I need all of the computers/tablets/phones I
have. Two iPads? Two laptops? Two iMacs?. C'mon. This should be easy,
but I love the iPad mini for most things, but the big iPad Pro is
great for watching shows and doodling with a Pencil. And I'm sure I
can find a good use for that "extra" iMac. I don't need it, but there
it sits, taking up my bandwidth.

*Blogs*. I've been getting better at this, but still have too much/many
blogs. I want only one or two so I don't have to think about where to
post what.

*Photo Sharing*. I post photos to Flickr, SmugMug, Instagram, Coping
Mechanism, Micro.blog, and Baty.net. That's nuts. I would like to pick
one for my photo gallery "home" and one for social sharing. Can't
decide, and it's crazy-making.

I could probably call all of this an attempt at "Minimalism" but I
stopped using that word once it had been usurped by so-called
"Productivity Gurus" and "Life Coaches". Blech, time for a new word.

Anyway, the gist is that I want to significantly reduce the number and
types of decisions I have to make every day.

Finally, I've gotten my beloved Leica M4 out of storage. It's been in

The camera was made in 1966 and I bought it in 2009. It's seen regular, if sporadic, use since
then. I think it's beautiful, and I especially like that it has the M3-style
levers.

I have the tiny and terrific Voightlander 35mm Color Skopar on it. That lens is almost /too/ small, but it makes fine images and was inexpensive.

It feels good to be using this setup again. I'll run a few rolls through it and see if I still become fatigued shooting with no meter at all.

[[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8166][This post at irreal]] laments the fact that people make such a big deal out of how their text editor looks, suggesting that it's only the functionality that matters.

He quotes [[https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/31970017734/new-frontiers-in-text-editing][Vivak Halder]]...

#+begin_quote
“why should you ever care how your editor looks, unless you’re trying to win a screenshot competition?”
#+end_quote

In general, I agree. What my editor can do and how it does it is what's most important.

But there's an easy answer to Vivak's question: I care about how my editor looks because /I stare at it all day/. How could I /not/ care deeply about how it looks?

There are many great reasons to defend Emacs, but appearance isn't one of them. Dismissing aesthetics as unnecessary feels like defensive rationalization.

I've spent many hours trying to improve the look and feel of my Emacs experience, and I've gotten it to the point where, while no one would call it beautiful, it's at least no longer aesthetically offensive.

I want the things I use and stare at all day to be pleasant. Emacs doesn't need to be beautiful, but it does need to be /nice/. 

Now, if I could only find a decent font and a light theme I don't hate[fn:leuven].

[fn:leuven] Please don't say "Leuven". I would try and make my own theme but I doubt I could come up with anything I like, even if I was capable of making one.


*** DONE Sticking with Dropbox :dropbox:icloud:

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: sticking-with-dropbox
:END:

It's fashionable lately to "ditch" Dropbox for other sync services. The reasons stated are usually around cost or privacy. This is understandable, but for anyone with a significant number of files and/or services using Dropbox, the time and complexity of switching could easily be costlier than what it would be to just continue using Dropbox.

Dropbox has only rarely caused me grief, and only with resource usage. Sometimes the client takes too many of them. Otherwise, it's been reliable and dependable for many years.

I've used Syncthing and Resilio Sync as alternatives. Both are fine, but other services depending on sync don't often support them, meaning I /still/ need to use Dropbox for some of my "stuff". This puts me in the unhappy situation of keeping things in 2 places. I did this for a while, and it ended up a confusing mess.

iCloud is handy, but only on my Macs and iOS devices. It's also never been as dependable as Dropbox. I've lost things. And stories like [[https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/11/icloud-data-loss-with-macos-10-15-and-ios-13-betas/][iCloud data loss with macos and ios 13 betas]] doesn't help my confidence.

I use Dropbox on Linux and I once fumblefingered a command and deleted a bunch of files. These were easily restored using Dropbox. I like the way Dropbox works today.

As much as I love to try new things, I don't feel that my file storage and sync system would benefit from the sort of tinkering that be would required to change it.

I'm bucking the trend and sticking with Dropbox.



*** DONE Wrangling Hugo's RSS templates :hugo:

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: wrangling-hugo-s-rss-templates
:END:

I just lost an hour "fixing" [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo's]] handling of RSS feeds.

Hugo's default rss template only includes each post's =.Summary=, but I want to include the full =.Content=. There is no configuration setting for this, so in order to include full post content I have to override the entire template. This seems nuts to me, but whatever. I had already done this a while ago and it's worked fine...until I updated Hugo to v0.55.0.

Hugo's 0.55.0 release introduced (what I consider) a breaking change which caused the RSS feed to include /all/ posts. The =rssLimit= configuration setting was replaced by a =[services.rss]= which relies on =Config.Services.RSS.Limit=. I wish someone would've told me. To be fair, there is something about this in the release notes but it's not obvious and doesn't call anything out as a breaking change, so I missed it.

I dutifully changed my settings to match, but it didn't fix the problem. Of course it didn't, because I'd overridden the default template and my version had no idea about =Config.Services.RSS.Limit=. The default RSS template is internal to Hugo but is [[https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/][shown in the documentation]]. I copied it over my own template, re-did my change to =.Summary= but still no luck. My RSS feed was still showing /all/ posts. Turns out the version in the docs was wrong. Instead, I poked around the code and found the [[https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/blob/master/tpl/tplimpl/embedded/templates/_default/rss.xml][actual source for the default RSS template]] and copied /that/ to ./layouts/index.rss.xml. Finally, I was again seeing full content and only the first 20 posts in the feed.

The problem then was that the feed contained entries for other non-post files that I'd edited. I only want posts in the feed, so I had to make an additional change to the template. The default is...

#+begin_example go
{{- $pages := Data.Pages -}}
#+end_example


I changed mine to...

#+begin_example go
{- $pages := (where .Data.Pages "Type" "post") -}}
#+end_example





Here's my final version of the template.

#+begin_src go
{{- $pages := (where .Data.Pages "Type" "post") -}}
{{- $limit := .Site.Config.Services.RSS.Limit -}}
{{- if ge $limit 1 -}}
{{- $pages = $pages | first $limit -}}
{{- end -}}
{{ printf "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\" ?>" | safeHTML }}
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    <title>{{ if eq  .Title  .Site.Title }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ else }}{{ with .Title }}{{.}} on {{ end }}{{ .Site.Title }}{{ end }}</title>

    {{ with .OutputFormats.Get "RSS" }}
        {{ printf "<atom:link href=%q rel=\"self\" type=%q />" .Permalink .MediaType | safeHTML }}
	{{ end }}
    {{- range $pages -}}
    <item>
      <title>{{ .Title }}</title>
      <link>{{ .Permalink }}</link>
      <pubDate>{{ .Date.Format "Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700" | safeHTML }}</pubDate>
      {{ with .Site.Author.email }}<author>{{.}}{{ with $.Site.Author.name }} ({{.}}){{end}}</author>{{end}}
      <guid>{{ .Permalink }}</guid>
      <description>{{ .Content | html }}</description>
    </item>
    {{ end }}
  </channel>
</rss>
#+end_src

And in config.toml I've replaced =rssLimit= with this...

#+begin_src toml
[services.rss]
  limit = 20
#+end_src

If there's an easier way to do all this I'd love to hear about it. Maybe the addition of the new =[services.rss]= section suggests other pending improvements. Ideally, I wouldn't need to override the entire RSS template in order to make these changes. And I'll be sure to read the release notes more thoroughly next time.

*** DONE Automatic Cross-posting :blogging:social:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: automatic-cross-posting
:END:

Should I automatically cross-post from baty.net to all the usual places? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I would just be adding noise where no more noise is needed. Other times I figure what the hell, everyone else does it and people seem to love noise. Besides, it's fun to share.

What I realized was that I often wish some of the people I follow would write more posts or show more photos or otherwise add to my feed. In the unlikely event that there are people out there who feel that way about me, I've once again enabled cross-posting. Apologies in advance if you're not one of them.

#+begin_quote
So here’s the thing I keep coming back to: I think of NetNewsWire as almost a kind of ideal public utility. As such, it should be completely trustworthy — you should never wonder if it’s leading you down some path or other you didn’t intend or foresee.

"trustworthy" is a good word and a great feature.

There are two things that cause me to occasionally abandon this blog at baty.net for something else.

The first is friction. Hosting with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] is wonderful, but /posting/ can feel like more trouble than it's worth. That's when things like [[https://blot.im][Blot]] or [[https://wordpress.org/][WordPress]] start to look tempting.

The second is boredom. I love trying new things, so whenever I find some new blogging tool, I trick myself into thinking "This is the one, for real this time!"

So, I stop posting here and add a message letting my handful of readers know where I've gone. Of course then I find myself looking something up here that I know I posted some time in the past 15 years and poking around and wondering why I ever left.

Since re-discovering [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co][ox-hugo - Org to Hugo exporter]], I've found ways to reduce the friction of publishing posts. And I love writing in Emacs and Org-mode.

All this to say that I've dusted off baty.net, re-jiggered my Hugo setup, and will be posting here again for a while.

*Hello, I'm Jack Baty*.

** A little about me

I’ve been a partner at [[https://fusionary.com][Fusionary Media]] since 1995. Fusionary is a
terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your business needs
something built for the web or mobile devices you should [[mailto:info@fusionary.com][send us a
note]].

I blog at *[[https://www.baty.net/][baty.net]]* ✒️

I've also been having a ball at my new wiki: [[https://rudimentarylathe.org][Rudimentary Lathe]].

You can email me at [[mailto:jack@baty.net][jack@baty.net]] ✉️

If you use ProtonMail and prefer a more secure method: [[mailto:jbaty@pm.me][jbaty@pm.me]] ✉️

I have a few other interests:

*Photography*. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera
collecting.” I shoot both film and digital and upload to [[https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty][Flickr]]

*Analog*. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like
film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and
fountain pens.

See the [[/now][Now page]] for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

**Do not expect consistency**.
