** DONE Org-Journal May Replace My Daybook.org File :org_mode:journal:
CLOSED: [2018-05-21 Mon 15:34]

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2018-05-21_org-journal-replaces-daybook
:END:
The more I use Bastian Bechtold's [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][Org-journal]] the more I like it.

For the past few years I've kept a sort of "Daybook" using a datetree in a
single Org-mode file. This works pretty well, but it's always felt more suitable
for shorter entries. I wanted something that would work with longer entries, so
I tried Org-journal.

Org-journal uses one file per day. I first thought that this would make browsing
my journal difficult, but it doesn't. I find the built-in search to be easier to
manage than using sparse trees or other search methods in an ordinary Org file.

I have found myself creating a journal entry using Org-journal for everything,
including the things I'd normally put into my Daybook.

Org-journal even handles TODOs, and carries forward any unfinished TODOs from
the previous day. It's kind of like an automated Bullet Journal.

I export things I write each month to PDF files and print them out. (Yes, I'm
that guy). With separate files for each day, I can do this by running
something like =cat 2018-05*.org > 2018-05-Journal.org= and export the resulting
file to a nicely-typeset PDF easily enough.

I'm not quite ready to completely let go of my habit of logging things into
my Daybook, but the writing is on the wall.


** DONE Let's try using ox-hugo again :blogging:hugo:org_mode:
CLOSED: [2018-05-20 Sun 13:52]

:END:

Last year, while looking for ways to create a blog using Org-mode, I ran across
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]]. It was clever, but I was uncomfortable with yet another layer of
abstration between the source text and the rendered HTML. I may have gotten over
that fear.

I'm slowly standardizing on using org-mode files for all of my writing. I'll
hate myself for this if I ever decide to stop using Emacs, but I'll deal with
that then.

[[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] has org-support [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/][built-in]], but it only supports a subset of org-mode's
features. For example, URLs or org-formatted links in footnotes are not rendered
as links in the final HTML files.

Ox-hugo works via the standard org-mode export dispatcher. The
result is rendered as a normal Hugo Markdown file. This means that if I decide to stop
using Org-mode for blog posts, or even move to another markdown-based site
builder, all of my posts are still there and usable as-is.

Another nice feature is that all of my posts are in a single org-mode file, one
subtree per post. I like this because I don't have to create a
properly-formatted markdown file in a specific folder in order to create a post.
I just set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property and ox-hugo takes in from there.

Of course I'm using a handy capture template, as provided by the ox-hugo docs.
This lets me type =C-c c h= to quickly create a new draft post.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
    "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
    (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
           (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
      (mapconcat #'identity
                 `(
                   ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                   ":PROPERTIES:"
                   ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " fname)
                   ":END:"
                   "%?\n")          ;Place the cursor here finally
                 "\n")))

  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("h"                ;`org-capture' binding + h
                 "Hugo post"
                 entry
                 ;; It is assumed that below file is present in `org-directory'
                 ;; and that it has a "Blog Ideas" heading. It can even be a
                 ;; symlink pointing to the actual location of all-posts.org!
                 (file+olp "all-posts.org" "Blog Ideas")
                 (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template))))
#+END_SRC
```

All subtrees marked as =TODO= are considered to be drafts. Toggling the
status to =DONE= sets "draft = false" and also sets the publish date to the
current time.

Tags are set just like normal org headings (e.g. "tag1:tag2"). 

Being able to directly publish to my Hugo-based blog while still living in an
Org-mode is pretty sweet.


** DONE Syncthing :sync:dropbox:

I've been testing [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] as a replacement for Dropbox and so far it's been great.

I am currently syncing over 25,000 files in 5 directories across two Macs and one
Linux machine. It has worked nearly without a hitch. I say "nearly" because
after changing the case of a few filenames those now show as "out of sync". They
synced fine but show as unsynced. I assume this is due to case-sensitive vs
case-insensitive file systems. I'll need to figure this out but it's more an
inconvenience than a problem[fn:1].

I'm still using Dropbox for things I'm sharing with others, and probably
always will, but for things I don't want anywhere near a "cloud", Syncthing
seems like a perfectly fine solution.



[fn:1] The case-insensitive rename issue is [[https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787][known]] and tricky to solve.
