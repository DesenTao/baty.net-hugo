** DONE Using Caddy for serving static content

I have a bunch of static files/websites laying around so I stood up an Amazon
Lightsail instance and installed the [[https://caddyserver.com][Caddy]] web server.

[[https://static.baty.net][static.baty.net]]

<!--more-->

A cool thing about Caddy is that it handles provisioning and installing SSL
certificates automatically from Let's Encrypt without me doing /anything/. It
also automatically redirects from http to https.

Here's the entire config file (Caddyfile)

#+BEGIN_SRC 
static.baty.net {
  root /home/jbaty/apps/static
  log /home/jbaty/logs/static.baty.net.log
  gzip
  browse
}
#+END_SRC

The =browse= directive enables directory browsing, and it even looks decent.

[[file:~/sites/blog/static/img/2018/2018-06-13_caddy-browse.png]]

Caddy can do all sorts of neat tricks, like serving up Markdown files as HTML
pages. Just drop Markdown files in a folder and add a =markdown= directive. I'm
sure I'll find a use for that. It would be neat if it could do the same with
Org-mode files.

I'm sure I'll explore the various plugins available. I see there's one for Hugo
sites, which looks interesting.

Having super-simple HTTPS automatically should be compelling for people looking
to get on the HTTPS-everywhere train.


** DONE The Frictionless Joy of Using a Single Platform

:END:

I've had so much fun these past few months learning my way around (Arch) Linux
on the desktop. Using a ThinkPad while mobile instead of a MacBook Pro or iPad
has been a pleasant change of pace.

I settled on the [[https://i3wm.org][i3 Window Manager]] and found it to be a totally new and mostly
pleasant way of working with windows. I tried all sorts of cool software that
I'd only read about before. I spent lots of time editing configuration files, tweaking the
dickens out of every possible feature. This has provided countless hours of
entertainment and I learned a lot.

However, I'm putting my Linux experiment on hold.

<!--more-->

It's the /idea/ of Linux that I love. Wall to wall freely distributed, open
source software is such a cool thing. Being free from reliance upon any one
particular vendor is a great feeling. Having endless choices for how the
operating system and software behave is liberating. I like having a variety of
hardware options and not being stuck with a brand new laptop with the shittiest
keyboard in the world. And I must admit, I don't mind the nerd creds that using
something like Arch provides. It makes me feel like I'm zagging, and I like
zagging. Everyone (well, not /everyone/) I know uses a MacBook Pro and it's fun
being the guy using something totally different.
 
But I run into problems. The trouble starts when constantly switching between
macOS and Linux. Keyboard shortcuts are close-but-not-quite the same. My shared
dotfile configuration needs exceptions so that paths and apps work correctly on
both systems. It's death by a thousand cuts.

Were I to switch completely to Linux I'd have none of these issues. Someday I
may go all Richard Stallman about software and that will be that. Until
then, I'll have to remain content being a "Mac Guy".

I'm not yet ready to give up the [[/2017/wonderful-software/][wonderful software]] I've used and loved for a
decade or more on my Mac. I'm not ready to find reliable substitutes for all the
little tweaks and scripts I've collected over the years. Mostly, I'm not ready
to put up with the constant friction of living in two similar-but-different
environments.

The ThinkPad will remain at hand, though. I like using it as a single-purpose
writing device. A screen split between Emacs, a Terminal, and a Browser makes
for a pretty tight, if not completely distraction-free, writing environment.
Plus, the keyboard is way better than the one on my MacBook Pro.

I'm also using the iPad more. 

"But wait a minute," you protest. "That's two different platforms, right?
Doesn't that cause the same problems?"

Good question, but no, it doesn't. The Mac and the iPad are entirely different
devices. Switching between them doesn't cause me to suffer from the "uncanny
valley" problem. They are so different that I don't try using them for the same
things in the same way like I've been doing with macOS and Linux. Seems weird,
maybe, but it makes sense to me. 

I'm sure that I'll hear about all sorts of ways to fix everything I've mentioned
and that "It's just a matter of editing foo.conf and memorizing 75 new key
bindings." Thanks, but no thanks. Not right now.

All this to say that I'm having fun tinkering with Linux but I'll be sticking
with my Macs and not worrying about whether every app I want to use is
cross-platform. I won't be worrying about /home vs /Users. I won't have to give
up any of my beloved tools. I won't suffer the mental friction caused by subtle
differences in how everything works.

[[/img/2018/2018-06-02_NUC-running-roon-core.jpg]]


I have been using [[https://roonlabs.com][Roon]] to manage and play my music collection and it's
wonderful.


I wrote a little about my first impressions [[/2018/the-roon-music-player-is-awesome/][here]]. In fact, I like it
so much that I paid the $499 fee for a lifetime subscription. This seems steep
only until you consider it as a critical component of an audio system. (See how
I rationalize?).

<!--more-->

#+CAPTION: Roon Player running on my iMac
[[/img/2018/2018-06-02_roon-screen.png]]

For the first couple of weeks I ran Roon "Core", the brains of the system, on my
iMac. This worked fine, but I wanted to offload the processing and storage
to a dedicated device.

Enter [[https://kb.roonlabs.com/Roon_Optimized_Core_Kit][Roon Optimized Core Kit]], which is a custom Linux build (RoonServer)
created specifically to run Roon Core on your own hardware. In my case, that
hardware is the [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4EOJNG/][Intel NUC7i3BNH]]. The NUC is a tiny, headless, silent server
perfect for running ROCK. 

All of my music is stored on the NUC's internal SSD drive. I don't have a large
library, but if I run out of room, I can easily plug one or more larger USB
drives into the NUC and tell Roon Core where the music is stored on them. Roon
manages all of my music regardless of where it's stored. When I buy new music
I only need to copy the files to the shared Roon drive and it's automatically
sorted, indexed, and fed into Roon's music database.

The Roon Core software running on the NUC is managed via a web control panel.
Once the initial installation is done, everything can be done headlessly.
Updates to ROCK are done right within the Player app. Considering several moving
parts, some rather technical, this has all worked flawlessly so far.

#+CAPTION: Roon's web control panel 
[[/img/2018/2018-06-02_roon-control-panel.png]]

Using Roon, I can easily control all of my music, stored anywhere, using any
device, and play it on any combination of HomePod, Sonos, and dedicated
amplifier. If I get bored with my own music collection, Roon's integration with
the [[http://tidal.com/us][Tidal streaming music service]] gives me access to any music I could ever
want, using the same system.

It's pretty great.

As someone who loves writing with analog tools, I have always switched willy
nilly between pens, pencils, notebooks, types of paper, etc. I never seemed to
find any consistent patterns. The past year has, finally, found me settling on a
pretty stable set of writing tools.

It goes like this:

For day-to-day note taking, I use a pencil. Go figure, right? I tried using the
Blackwings, which are wildly popular with the fancy pencil set. They write well
enough, but they're too long and no one talks about the elephant in the room;
that big, clumsy, eraser with the sharp metal bits. They look funny and feel
icky, so I switched to something I have grown to love - the Mitsu-bishi Hi-uni
and 9850 pencils. They write at least as well as the Blackwings, cost less, and
hold a point better.

[[file:~/sites/blog/static/img/2018/2018-05-23_mitsu-bishi.jpg]]

For my daily updates in the Hobonichi Techo, I'm still in love with the Staedtler
Pigment Liners. The fine, black, crisp line works great on the small pages of
Tomoe River paper.

[[file:~/sites/blog/static/img/2018/2018-05-23_staedtler.jpg]]

And for anything "fancy" like letters, postcards, or long-form journaling, I have
settled on two fountain pens; The TWSBI Diamond 580 and the Pelikan M400.

[[file:~/sites/blog/static/img/2018/2018-05-23_fountain-pens.jpg]]

I'm pretty happy with these choices. It's been months since I've struggled with
deciding what to write with.

I started receiving meals from [[https://www.blueapron.com/][Blue Apron]] five years ago today. For someone who's been
living alone, meal delivery services are wonderful. I hate shopping, I never
know what to shop for anyway, and I'm not a great cook. When I do shop I'm
forced to buy more than I need and things get thrown away. Or I just buy hot
dogs and stuff to make nachos and desserts.

Blue Apron meals are always interesting, colorful, and delicious. They take some
work to prepare, though. It seemed like I was always small-dicing what felt
like 35 ingredients at every meal. So, I started looking for alternatives.

My sister had been using [[https://www.homechef.com/][HomeChef]] and claimed the meals were super simple. I
switched, and she was right. They also offered a two-meal/week plan. Blue Apron
was limited to three meals. HomeChef also allowed me to choose between a nice
variety of dishes each week. With Blue Apron I just took whatever they sent.

After nearly a year, I checked in on Blue Apron and found that they had made
things simpler, now offer a two-meal plan, and have a decent selection of
meals to choose from. I switched back and couldn't be happier.

The photo above is of tonight's dish, "Tokyo Beef & Rice Bowls with Soft-Boiled
Eggs and Roasted Brocolli." I used their photo here because mine didn't turn out
looking nearly that good, but it was delicious! So good in fact that it prompted
me to write this post.

I'm happy to be back with Blue Apron. If you're looking for a meal delivery
service, I'd give the nod to Blue Apron, but you wouldn't be disappointed with
HomeChef either.

** DONE Org-Journal May Replace My Daybook.org File :org_mode:journal:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2018-05-21_org-journal-replaces-daybook
:END:
The more I use Bastian Bechtold's [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][Org-journal]] the more I like it.

For the past few years I've kept a sort of "Daybook" using a datetree in a
single Org-mode file. This works pretty well, but it's always felt more suitable
for shorter entries. I wanted something that would work with longer entries, so
I tried Org-journal.

Org-journal uses one file per day. I first thought that this would make browsing
my journal difficult, but it doesn't. I find the built-in search to be easier to
manage than using sparse trees or other search methods in an ordinary Org file.

I have found myself creating a journal entry using Org-journal for everything,
including the things I'd normally put into my Daybook.

Org-journal even handles TODOs, and carries forward any unfinished TODOs from
the previous day. It's kind of like an automated Bullet Journal.

I export things I write each month to PDF files and print them out. (Yes, I'm
that guy). With separate files for each day, I can do this by running
something like =cat 2018-05*.org > 2018-05-Journal.org= and export the resulting
file to a nicely-typeset PDF easily enough.

I'm not quite ready to completely let go of my habit of logging things into
my Daybook, but the writing is on the wall.

** DONE Let's try using ox-hugo again :blogging:hugo:org_mode:
CLOSED: [2018-05-20 Sun 13:52]
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 2018-05-20-lets-try-ox-hugo-again
:END:

Last year, while looking for ways to create a blog using Org-mode, I ran across
[[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]]. It was clever, but I was uncomfortable with yet another layer of
abstration between the source text and the rendered HTML. I may have gotten over
that fear.

I'm slowly standardizing on using org-mode files for all of my writing. I'll
hate myself for this if I ever decide to stop using Emacs, but I'll deal with
that then.

[[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] has org-support [[https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/][built-in]], but it only supports a subset of org-mode's
features. For example, URLs or org-formatted links in footnotes are not rendered
as links in the final HTML files.

Ox-hugo works via the standard org-mode export dispatcher. The
result is rendered as a normal Hugo Markdown file. This means that if I decide to stop
using Org-mode for blog posts, or even move to another markdown-based site
builder, all of my posts are still there and usable as-is.

Another nice feature is that all of my posts are in a single org-mode file, one
subtree per post. I like this because I don't have to create a
properly-formatted markdown file in a specific folder in order to create a post.
I just set the =EXPORT_FILE_NAME= property and ox-hugo takes in from there.

Of course I'm using a handy capture template, as provided by the ox-hugo docs.
This lets me type =C-c c h= to quickly create a new draft post.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org-capture
  (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
    "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.

    (let* ((title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
           (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
      (mapconcat #'identity
                 `(
                   ,(concat "* TODO " title)
                   ":PROPERTIES:"
                   ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " fname)
                   ":END:"
                   "%?\n")          ;Place the cursor here finally
                 "\n")))

  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
               '("h"                ;`org-capture' binding + h
                 "Hugo post"
                 entry
                 ;; It is assumed that below file is present in `org-directory'
                 ;; and that it has a "Blog Ideas" heading. It can even be a
                 ;; symlink pointing to the actual location of all-posts.org!
                 (file+olp "all-posts.org" "Blog Ideas")
                 (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template))))
#+END_SRC
```

All subtrees marked as =TODO= are considered to be drafts. Toggling the
status to =DONE= sets "draft = false" and also sets the publish date to the
current time.

Tags are set just like normal org headings (e.g. "tag1:tag2"). 

Being able to directly publish to my Hugo-based blog while still living in an
Org-mode is pretty sweet.

I've been testing [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] as a replacement for Dropbox and so far it's been great.

I am currently syncing over 25,000 files in 5 directories across two Macs and one
Linux machine. It has worked nearly without a hitch. I say "nearly" because
after changing the case of a few filenames those now show as "out of sync". They
synced fine but show as unsynced. I assume this is due to case-sensitive vs
case-insensitive file systems. I'll need to figure this out but it's more an
inconvenience than a problem[fn:1].

I'm still using Dropbox for things I'm sharing with others, and probably
always will, but for things I don't want anywhere near a "cloud", Syncthing
seems like a perfectly fine solution.



[fn:1] The case-insensitive rename issue is [[https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787][known]] and tricky to solve.

Gail. Hasselbad 500C/M. Hand-held and guessed exposure. It's under-exposed it so
I had to pull it up a bit which really cranks up the grain.

The combination of recent Github/Microsoft rumors and my

projects http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki

On the first of every month I start a new section in each of my notebooks. I
also export last months org-journal entries to LaTeX->PDF and print them. I
can't explain why I love it so much, but it could be my favorite day.

I've removed all of the "smart" features from the lighting in my house. What a
relief. I can now turn lights on and off any time I want, by just flipping
a switch. No cursing or magic vocal incantations necessary.

It's been a long time since I've loaded slide film into a camera. This roll
expired more than 15 years ago so all bets are off.

Companies are deleting the user data they've been collecting and many have also
decided that it's just not worth collecting it in the first place. I'm happy to
suffer a week of GDPR privacy notice emails for this.
