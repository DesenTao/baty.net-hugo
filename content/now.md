A few of the things I'm working on or thinking about as of **Sunday, January 13, 2019**

- Exploring my renewed interest in digital photography
- Reading "[Jack Reacher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37752621-how-to-invent-everything)" by Lee Child. Time for something easy I guess.
- Having a ball with my new wiki at [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org)
- Wondering what I'm going to be when I grow up.

(_The idea for this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3]_)
