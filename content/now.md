A few of the things I’m doing as of **Friday, August 28, 2020**

- Trying to live in [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). This now includes the
  content that was formerly maintained on [the
  wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org/). We’ll see.
- Reading [How to be an
  Anti-Racist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40815366-how-to-be-an-antiracist) by
  Ibram X. Kendi
- Playing with [HEY email](https://hey.com/)
- Moving the blog back to WordPress so it’s more fun to post photos
- Oh yeah, we sold [the company](https://fusionary.com/), so I’m now a
  consultant there, 3 days a week. It’s weird, but exciting.
