A few of the things I'm working on or thinking about as of Saturday, June 9, 2018

- Practicing meditation for real this time. 15 minutes a day for now, but it's a start.
- Still having a ball on [Micro.blog][1]
- Reading "[The Joy of Missing
  Out](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535637-the-joy-of-missing-out)" by Christina Crook
- Listening to pretty much _everything_ using my new [Roon/NUC setup](https://www.baty.net/2018/the-intel-nuc-and-roon-as-my-music-system/)
- Just started staging my house so it can be put up for sale

(_The idea for this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3]_)
