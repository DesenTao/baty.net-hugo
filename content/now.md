A few of the things I'm working on or thinking about as of **Saturday, September 15, 2018**

- Exploring my renewed interest in _color_ film photography
- Reading "[A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16190608-a-gentle-madness)" by Nicholas A. Basbanes
- Listening to pretty much _everything_ using my new [Roon/NUC setup](https://www.baty.net/2018/the-intel-nuc-and-roon-as-my-music-system/)
- Accepted an offer on my house, so prepping for close. Yikes!
