A few of the things I’m working on or thinking about as of January 14, 2018

- Practicing meditation for real this time
- Dialing in my plaintextaccounting using Ledger
- Having a ball on [Micro.blog][1]
- Messing around with my blogs (I have several now, sigh)
- Reading "Lathe of Heaven" by Ursula K. Le Guin
- Listening to pretty much _everything_ using my new HomePod

(_The idea for this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3]_)
