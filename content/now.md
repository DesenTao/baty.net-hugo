A few of the things I'm working on or thinking about as of **Thursday, November 22, 2018**

- Exploring my renewed interest in digital photography
- Reading "[How to Invent Everything: A Survival Guide for the Stranded Time Traveller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37752621-how-to-invent-everything)" by Ryan North
- Listening to pretty much _everything_ using my new [Roon/NUC setup](https://www.baty.net/2018/the-intel-nuc-and-roon-as-my-music-system/)
- I've recently moved, so I'm still adapting to a new environment

(_The idea for this page was inspired by [Derek Sivers][3]_)
