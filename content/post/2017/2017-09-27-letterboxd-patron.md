I just renewed my annual [Letterboxd][1] membership. This time I paid $49 for a year at the &#8220;Patron&#8221; level. Letterboxd is the best way I&#8217;ve ever found to manage, record, and discover movies. I love it. Paying $49 per year is an easy decision.

I&#8217;m atÂ [letterboxd.com/jackbaty][2]. Follow me there.
