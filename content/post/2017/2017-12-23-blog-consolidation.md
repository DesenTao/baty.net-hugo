_(I originally posted this as the [last post][1] on www.baty.net but thought I'd copy it here.)﻿_

The end of each year always has me thinking about simplifying things. To that end, I’m going to try consolidating my online presence. I’ll no longer be posting at www.baty.net.

For blogging, I’m going to try posting everything here at [jack.baty.net][2].

Anything longer or more “important” than a tweet goes on the One True Blog™.

For shorter things, I’ll probably use [Mastodon][3] and cross-post to [Twitter][4] and via RSS to [micro.blog][5]. “But what about owning your content!?” you ask. Lately, the way I figure it if it’s not important enough for a title I don’t care if I “own” it or not. If that changes I'll probably just keep a hosted micro.blog blog for short posts.
