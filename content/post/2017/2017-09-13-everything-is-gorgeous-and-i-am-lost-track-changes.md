> Lately, though, I’ve often found myself halfway through a poorly-considered post before realizing I was devoting reading time to a hack job. We’ve developed a sense of the signifiers of thoughtfully-assembled web sites in the last decade, but these days it’s all a wash of 21px #333 Georgia.

I do appreciate nice, readable typography, but dammit can&#8217;t we have fun any more? When choosing a template for jack.baty.net I wanted something unique and fun but ended up with a simple, readable, basic layout. I guess for now this hack job remains part of the problem.
