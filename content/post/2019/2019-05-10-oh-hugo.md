I search this blog (baty.net) nearly every day looking for some reference or topic. I stopped posting here earlier this year, and I'm reminded that I miss it on a daily basis.

This thing goes back to 2000 and has thousands of posts. I like the theme and I like static HTML controlled by version-controlled Markdown files. I like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Let's post here for a bit, shall we? Just for old times' sake.
