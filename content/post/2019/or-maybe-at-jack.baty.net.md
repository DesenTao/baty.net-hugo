One reason[^why] I stopped posting here at baty.net is
[easy-hugo](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo) stopped
working[^github]. 

While I waited for a fix, I started posting at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog)
since Blot is similar to Hugo in that it's just text files. 

Then I got even lazier and started posting again to my WordPress blog at
[jack.baty.net](https://jack.baty.net).

Long, repeating story short, I'm busy at jack.baty.net for now also.


[^why]: A reason that actually makes sense and isn't just based on my mood.
[^github]: See [issue](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo/issues/47)
