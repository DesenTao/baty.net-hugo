This can't be happening, right? For like 4 months I don't post anything here and "move" my blog to [baty.blog](https://www.baty.blog/) because Blot is awesome and that's that.

Yet here we are, creating posts for Hugo to toss up here at baty.net. This isn't any sort of official move, I just feel like tinkering today.
