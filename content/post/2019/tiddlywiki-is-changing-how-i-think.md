I remain infatuated with [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com). There’s a certain genius in its design that has captured my imagination.

As an experiment, I started a new wiki and published it at [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org/).
I’m easily distracted by shiny new things, so I spent a few days learning my way
around TiddlyWiki by posting notes and miscellaneous snippets there.

What I’m finding is that TiddlyWiki is changing how I think about writing
online. I don’t yet understand why, but I suspect it’s about being able to just
throw things at it without feeling like I’m “publishing”. There’s no RSS feed.
The only way anyone else might read what I write there is if I link to it on my
“real” blog or if someone just stumbles upon it. It feels like a personal, but
not private, space.

I think of each “tiddler” in my wiki is just a blob of text that is by default
unrelated to everything else. I can link and tag them in order to define some
semblance of structure, but it’s not necessary. There are “Recent” and “New”
tabs but otherwise there’s not really a “timeline” of any sort. I’m currently
putting recent entries on the main “Story” view but that’s probably just
vestigial behavior from years of a reverse-chronological mindset. It’s very
refreshing!

Any wiki could do most of this, but there’s something different the way
TiddlyWiki goes about it. It feels different, in that it’s not page-based, but
note-based. Or maybe thought-based. I don’t know what it is exactly, but I’m
digging it.

So, what am I putting at rudimentarylathe.org? I’m not sure yet. So far it’s been…

- Daily “Journal” posts about whatever I’m thinking about
- Notes about software that I use or want to use
- Technical notes on how I solved problems
- Things I’ve learned
- Quotes or interesting bits from things I’ve read
- Books I’ve read
- ???

I can’t wait to see where this goes.
