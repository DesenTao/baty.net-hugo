This blog is statically-rendered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which means
there's no easy set of plugins for adding Webmentions. There's nothing like the
[IndieWeb plugins](https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins) for WordPress. I've
been collecting webmentions for a while via
[webmention.io](https://webmention.io) but needed a way to render them here. I
had to roll my own.

Well, to be honest, I just stood over [Karl's](https://twitter.com/kswedberg/) shoulder while he wrote the JavaScript for me. It's great watching a master at work. It would have taken me days to cobble something together. Karl did it in less than an hour. I tweaked it just a little, added some CSS, and boom! Webmentions.

I'm sure I'll want to dial things in, but this is a fine start.
