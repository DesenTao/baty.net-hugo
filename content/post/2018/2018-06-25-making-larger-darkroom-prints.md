I made a handfull of 11&#8243; x 14&#8243; darkroom prints last night. Bigger prints are cool, but I never know what toÂ _do_ with them.

Mostly, I print at 5&#215;7. The smaller paper is relatively inexpensive so I don&#8217;t freak out every time I waste a sheet (and I waste a lot of sheets). Smaller prints are easy to handle, display, and store.

Still, big prints are fun. I&#8217;ve got about 100 sheets sitting in the freezer so I might as well use them up.
