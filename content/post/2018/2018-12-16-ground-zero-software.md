The fun part of any venture is naming things, so when I started my own little software development company back in the early 90s, I spent a lot of time thinking up a business name.

This, unfortunately, is what I came up with:<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-12-16_Ground-Zero-Software-business-card-original-copy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2177" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-12-16_Ground-Zero-Software-business-card-original-copy.jpg 521w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2018-12-16_Ground-Zero-Software-business-card-original-copy-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /><figcaption>Ground Zero Software business card prototype</figcaption></figure> 

With only a little imagination, even the logo I made could be a premonition.Â 

Fortunately, the name went away when we founded Fusionary Media just a couple years later, in 1995
