I've been testing [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] as a replacement for Dropbox and so far it's been great.

I am currently syncing over 25,000 files in 5 directories across two Macs and one
Linux machine. It has worked nearly without a hitch. I say "nearly" because
after changing the case of a few filenames those now show as "out of sync". They
synced fine but show as unsynced. I assume this is due to case-sensitive vs
case-insensitive file systems. I'll need to figure this out but it's more an
inconvenience than a problem.

I'm still using Dropbox for things I'm sharing with others, and probably
always will, but for things I don't want anywhere near a "cloud", Syncthing
seems like a perfectly fine solution.
