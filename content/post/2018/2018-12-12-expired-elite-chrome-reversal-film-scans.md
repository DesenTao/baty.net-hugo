I shot a roll of very expired Elite Chrome and since I don&#8217;t have any E-6 chemistry I sent it out for processing. I don&#8217;t know why I bother with color film. The scans were super noisy and grainy and the color was icky. I&#8217;m not sure how much of this was due to the age of the film and how much was in the processing. 

I&#8217;m still planning to try the new Ektachrome, so we&#8217;ll see if that&#8217;s any better.
