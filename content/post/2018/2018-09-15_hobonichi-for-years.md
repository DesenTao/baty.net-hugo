2019 will be my seventh year using a [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/).

The Techo is great for planning, doodling, scheduling, and journaling. It uses Tomoe River paper, which is magically thin yet still usable with just about any writing tool. There are many fun covers available. but I love the size and the feel of the bare notebook so I've never used one.

I've noticed that the Techo has become my default notebook for nearly everything. I have almost always carried a mid-sized notebook like a Moleskin or
Leuchtturm for use as a modified [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com) but lately I've been leaving that at home and only used the Techo.

It's nice to find things that I enjoy and find useful consistently for many years.
