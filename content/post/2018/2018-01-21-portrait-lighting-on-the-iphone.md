<figure style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img title="kelly-portrait.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-portrait.jpg" alt="Kelly portrait" width="960" height="1280" border="0" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kelly. (iPhone X)</figcaption></figure>

Portrait Lighting on the iPhone X can be a fun, dramatic effect, but I’ve yet to see it hold up on anything much larger than a phone screen. The above image of my niece Kelly is a pretty typical example. It looks impressive on the phone, but view it at any reasonable size and it kind of falls down. She _loved_ it when I showed it to her on the phone, so maybe I’m just being too critical.

It’s possible I’m doing something wrong or using Portrait Lighting in situations where it doesn’t make sense, so I’ll keep trying.
