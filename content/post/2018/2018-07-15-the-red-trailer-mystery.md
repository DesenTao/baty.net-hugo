The first real book I ever read was &#8220;Trixie Belden and the Red Trailer Mystery&#8221;. I read it, I think in one sitting, while camped out under my grandmother&#8217;s kitchen table. My original copy is, sadly, long gone. I&#8217;m feeling nostalgic this week, so I picked up a replacement copy of the book from eBay. I can&#8217;t wait to read it again.
