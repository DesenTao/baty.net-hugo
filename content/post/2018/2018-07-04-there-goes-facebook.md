I finally, officially deleted my Facebook account today. No need to make a big deal about it. We all know by now that getting away from Facebook is the right move. My account has been deactivated for months, but today felt like a fine day to be done with it for good. It is, after all, &#8220;Independence Day&#8221; ðŸ™‚

I just wanted to write it down.
