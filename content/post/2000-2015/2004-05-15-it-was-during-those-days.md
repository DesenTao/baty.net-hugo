It was during those days
  
strange and wonderful, when
  
timid turned to tumultous
  
mystery gave way to mastery
  
each moment hiding its own fear
  
(the possibility of it being the last)
  
the early, furtive attempts
  
revealed suprising results
  
of unbridled motion and sound.
  
when we rode that graceful white horse
  
of newly discovered combinations of
  
movement and placement,
  
positional pliability explored
  
in a densely passionate fog of
  
sweat and breath and smoke.
