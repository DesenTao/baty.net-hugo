          <span><strong>A 750 word poem written in one breath</strong></span> 
          
          <p>
            I have been diligently writing my 750words every day for 34 days. Tonight, I had nothing to say, so I thought I'd blurt out a 750 word poem in one breath, without stopping. Technically it's 761 words, but who's counting? I am subjecting you to this not because it's a good poem, but because it's a fast poem. And it was fun to write.

            Let's be honest, I must lie<br />do or make or cause to cry<br />and take your hand from far away<br />it's used to only slap and pray<br />and see if I just watch and wait<br />while all the others give and take<br />this may be nothing, all a joke<br />but you'll forgive me what I wrote<br />and if we fall into a hole<br />once and for all we'll know our role<br />in which the play plays out its play<br />while you've forgotten yesterday<br />it is too late to wonder why<br />each day and night I pass you by<br />to see if you will notice me<br />or if you've seen my fleeting glee<br />to take us to that very place<br />where none are caught despite the chase<br />investigate the mother's yarn<br />into the other's loving arm<br />you've never seen me take a thing<br />while dancing into brilliant spring<br />each fuck and fancy builds to this<br />yet started with an empty kiss<br />beware the rending of a heart<br />it finishes without a start<br />but never knows a single dance<br />or makes a thing bereft of chance<br />and never runs into the wall<br />or curls itself into a ball<br />of fate will not allow portents<br />or random silly accidents<br />not walk not run not move a bit<br />for fear of losing all of it<br />to theft of joy or bully thus<br />then takes so much from each of us<br />that such is known but much is lost<br />into a fading muddy past<br />when each and only runs aground<br />we only ever hear the sound<br />of fools and creatures lost in time<br />who take and get and say "that's mine!"<br />should never live to see the day<br />in june or august, march or may<br />into the darkness shining dim<br />and gasp at every thought of him<br />who makes the sunlight take its leave<br />and all the happy ones bereave<br />to wander into lonely rooms<br />beneath a single sad mushroom<br />that sprang from filth left far behind<br />and into crust of earth and rind<br />go further onward within reach<br />until the darkness has been breached<br />it screams a mighty fearful scream<br />and tells each of us what to dream<br />for fear of wondering aloud<br />those things we know are not allowed<br />it cannot be it only seems<br />that singing is the sound of dreams<br />all wrapped in bows of false and fake<br />another empty dawn will break<br />we see yet we cannot defend<br />our actions or our riches lend<br />a hand or other limb to those<br />who've sliced the thorn off from the rose<br />and petals drift among the clouds<br />to silence agonizing crowds<br />of those without and those within<br />who speak of solitude and sin<br />and sex and will we ever come<br />and when and if we might have some<br />in time it shows a perfect time<br />a way in which those things sublime<br />writhe into out of up and down<br />pushing deeper under ground<br />we mold our habits foolishly<br />while others trip and fall and flee<br />but all is wonderful and rich<br />and sounds deliver perfect pitch<br />with ear to door and wall and earth<br />we hear the glowing after birth<br />but fail to know what is to come<br />our ending is beginnings womb<br />for someone elsewhere out to play<br />another sense of feigned dismay<br />so that we feel each other's pain<br />cannot be washed away by rain<br />or weather not meant to be known<br />a blinding light is never shown<br />until the bottom rung we grasp<br />unfastening the final clasp<br />it falls way under the bed<br />never too be seen or said<br />that if we cannot hide our need<br />and wear it all out on our sleeve<br />then take and take and give and get<br />but lose that goddamn safety net<br />for fear of falling keeps us down<br />as if we've never left the ground<br />so rise and touch and tamper with<br />that softer smaller one who is<br />beneath you when you feel as low<br />when nothing is allowed to grow<br />and reach and pull and grunt and tug<br />into the whole that you have dug<br />around and in and up and down<br />there is no scream when losing ground<br />it takes away the final groan<br />and sends the other far from home<br />we've never looked into this breach<br />and now we fear it's out of reach<br />but once we twisted wrapped and warm<br />with pleasure covering the harm<br />and you and I and nearby sleep<br />(I pray there is a soul to keep)<br />we barely notice when the quiver
