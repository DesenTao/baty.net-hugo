hearing that the drummer has begun
  
She &#8211; being the dancer &#8211; moves,
  
smiling slightly behind closed eyes
  
knowing this particular rhythm

ignoring the confused stares
  
i &#8211; watching the dancer &#8211; sit very still,
  
nodding slowly as if in agreement
  
knowing that particular smile&#8230;

&#8230;and begin to sing.
