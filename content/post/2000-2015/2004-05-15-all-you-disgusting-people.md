All you disgusting people
  
who settle for less
  
than dreams
  
Shame!
  
Look up from that
  
crowded trough and
  
spit the tasteless soup
  
of boredom and cages
  
onto the beaten ground
  
of what's expected of you.
  
Walk
  
(crawl if you must)
  
out from that vile herd
  
of mediocrity and nay-sayers
  
who would keep from you
  
what you wish for.
  
If you follow yourself
  
Who leads but the dreamer?
