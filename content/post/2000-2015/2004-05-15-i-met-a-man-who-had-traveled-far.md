I met a man who had traveled far.
  
"Show me a place where I'll find love.", I said
  
It was a long journey
  
We walked for many days
  
We came to a beautiful white place.
  
He said, "This is where you wished to go."
  
I asked if he was coming too
  
He answered, "No, I've been here before."
  
And sadly walked on.
