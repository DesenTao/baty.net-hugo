title: the dress reveals nothing really

the dress reveals nothing really
  
(cotton, isn't it?)
  
but quietly suggests the subtle
  
and delicate promise of all that
  
Spring has told me
  
and never gets quite right.

clarified now by soft color
  
against the perfect whiteness of skin
  
clever Spring! never spoke of you
  
one hand touches both flower and flesh
  
as Spring sits silently&#8230;waiting.
