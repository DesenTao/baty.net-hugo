even with the pieces gone
  
removed by recent things
  
which maybe scar and offer up
  
internal bites and stings

there still remains a part of you
  
(some would argue "most")
  
that can and will and must and may
  
replace what has been lost

with new and bright and future tense
  
and passion, comfortable
  
there's room to spare â€“ I've seen it there
  
and love when you are able.
