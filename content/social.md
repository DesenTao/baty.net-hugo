## My weblogs and other publishing experiments

- [micro.baty.net](https://micro.baty.net/) - My Microblog published with [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/)

- [tilde.club/~jbaty](http://tilde.club/~jbaty) - because nostalgia is strong and Paul Ford is my hero

## Photography

- [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com/) - Where I organize albums and store things
- [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty/) - I've been posting photos to Flickr since forever. Flickr is still the best photo sharing service, even though it's fallen out of favor in recent years.
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mrjackbaty) - I've stopped posting to Instagram because of the pervasive ads and horrible feed algorithm

## Social media
