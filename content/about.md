**Hello there. I’m Jack Baty and this is my personal space.**

I’ve been a partner at [Fusionary Media](https://fusionary.com) since 1995. Fusionary is a terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If you need something built for the web or mobile devices you should [drop us a line](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

Outside of helping create digital products at Fusionary, I have a few interests:

- **Photography**. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera collecting.” Most of my photographs are shot on film, processed and printed in my darkroom.
- **Analog things**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks and fancy pens and pencils.
- **Now**. I keep a page updated with things I’m tinkering with at the moment at https://baty.net/now

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net).

**I don't have a plan**.

## My weblog and other publishing experiments

- [baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) - You're soaking in it
- [jack.baty.net](https://jack.baty.net/) - When I think I want to move to WordPress I just post a few things here
- [micro.baty.net](https://micro.baty.net/) - A Microblog using Micro.blog
- [tilde.club/~jbaty](http://tilde.club/~jbaty) - because nostalgia is strong and Paul Ford is my hero

## Photography

- [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com/) - Where I organize albums and store things
- [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty/) - I've been posting photos to Flickr since forever. Flickr is still the best photo sharing service, even though it's fallen out of favor in recent years.
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mrjackbaty) - I've stopped posting to Instagram because of the pervasive ads and horrible feed algorithm

## Social media

- [@jackbaty](https://twitter.com/jackbaty) on Twitter. I read more on Twitter than I post, but feel free to @ or DM me there.
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jackbaty) is where I track and rate the movies I watch
- [Jackbaty](https://www.facebook.com/jackbaty) on Facebook. I'm still on Facebook but I don't go there.
