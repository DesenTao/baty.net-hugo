**Hello, I'm Jack Baty**.


## A little about me {#a-little-about-me}

I’ve been a partner at [Fusionary Media](https://fusionary.com) since 1995. Fusionary is a
terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your business needs
something built for the web or mobile devices you should [send us a
note](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

I blog at **[baty.net](https://www.baty.net/)** ✒️

I've also been having a ball at my new wiki: [Rudimentary Lathe](https://rudimentarylathe.org).

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net) ✉️

If you use ProtonMail and prefer a more secure method: [jbaty@pm.me](mailto:jbaty@pm.me) ✉️

I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera
collecting.” I shoot both film and digital and upload to [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty)

**Analog**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like
film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and
fountain pens.

See the [Now page](/now) for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

****Do not expect consistency****.
