## A little about me {#a-little-about-me}

I was a partner at Fusionary Media from 1995 until May 2020. I remain there in a consulting role. Fusionary is a terrific
digital development studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your business needs something built for
the web or mobile devices you should üíå [send us a note](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

I blog here at [baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) ‚úíÔ∏è and at [copingmechanism.com](https://copingmechanism.com)

For the past few years I've maintained a wiki at [Rudimentary Lathe](https://rudimentarylathe.org).
This has shifted recently to a [public Roam database](https://)

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net) ‚úâÔ∏è. I still like receiving email!

I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it ‚Äúphotography‚Äù but it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúcamera collecting.‚Äù I
shoot both film and digital and upload to Flickr

**Analog**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film
cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and fountain pens.

See the [Now page](/now) for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

Do not expect consistency.
