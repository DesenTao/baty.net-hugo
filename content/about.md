**Hello there. I’m Jack Baty and this is my personal space.**

I’ve been a partner at [Fusionary Media](https://fusionary.com) since 1995. Fusionary is a terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If you need something built for the web or mobile devices you should [drop us a line](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

Outside of helping create digital products at Fusionary, I have a few interests:

- **Photography**. I call it “photography” but it’s more like “camera collecting.” Most of my photographs are shot on film, processed and printed in my darkroom.
- **Analog things**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks and fancy pens and pencils.
- **Now**. I keep a page updated with things I’m tinkering with at the moment at https://baty.net/now

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net).

**I don't have a plan**.
