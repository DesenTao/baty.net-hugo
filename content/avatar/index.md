I was buying some old camera gear from a guy, when I noticed a pile of negatives on his kitchen table. He didn't know who they belonged to originally, and was happy to sell them to me along with the rest of the items.

The negatives were family photos from the early 1900s. One of my favorites shows a man with a pipe wearing overalls pushing a woman in a wheelbarrow. I love the photo. They both are laughing, and the man's smile looks so genuine and comical that I now use it for my avatar. It makes me happy.
