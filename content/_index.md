**Hello, I'm Jack Baty**.

I‚Äôve been a partner at **[Fusionary Media](https://fusionary.com)** since 1995. Fusionary is a terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your business needs something built for the web or mobile devices you should [send us a note](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

I blog at **[Baty.blog](https://www.baty.blog/)** ‚úíÔ∏è

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net) ‚úâÔ∏è

If you use ProtonMail and prefer a more secure method: [jbaty@protonmail.com](mailto:jbaty@protonmail.com) ‚úâÔ∏è

I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it ‚Äúphotography‚Äù but it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúcamera collecting.‚Äù I shoot both film and digital and upload to [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty) üì∑

**Analog**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and fountain pens.

See the ["Now" page](https://baty.net/now) ‚è± for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

**Do not expect consistency**.
