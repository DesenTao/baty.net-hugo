**Hello, I'm Jack Baty**.

I‚Äôm a partner at **[Fusionary Media](https://fusionary.com)**, a terrific digital studio in Grand Rapids, MI. If your company needs something built for the web or mobile devices you should [send us a note](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

Mostly, I blog at **[Baty.blog](https://baty.blog/)** ‚úíÔ∏è.

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net) ‚úâÔ∏è.

If you have a ProtonMail account and prefer more secure communication: [jbaty@protonmail.com](mailto:jbaty@protonmail.com) ‚úâÔ∏è.


I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it ‚Äúphotography‚Äù but it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúcamera collecting.‚Äù I shoot both film and digital and upload to [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty) üì∑.

**Analog things**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks and fancy pens and pencils.

I also keep a ["Now" page](https://baty.net/now) ‚è± with a list of more specific current interests and projects.


**I don't have a plan**.
